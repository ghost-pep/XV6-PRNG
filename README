In order to run in the terminal:
	the test => exec "selecttest"
	pipenet  => exec "pipenet"

A detailed description of my pipenet modifications are at the top of pipenet.c.


	Thoughts about Lab 4
I thought this lab was much better laid/layed out than the previous ones. However, There were
some things that were left out of the assignment that would have been useful
like the helper functions for selid and the clrsel methods. Lastly, I think it
would have been helpful to give an overall description of what the endgoal 
is. I was pretty confused starting it and ended up blindly 
following the directions. Not sure if that's my fault or not, but something
to think about. I think Erich's pciture presented in the PPT would be useful
to include in the assignment page.

I also think the pipenet program is pretty dope.
